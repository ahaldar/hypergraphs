Reference implementation of various hypergraph algorithms with an emphasis on
clarity and generality over performance.

If you have questions about this code, please let me know.

I have decided to release it in a somewhat rough state.  I am happy to expand it
in a number of ways if there is a demand for it.


However, even in its current state, I believe that there is a lot of useful
stuff worked out and implemented.  Most notable are the advanced dynamic
programming algorithms presented in
